       "\" If you are as young as 14, some companies will not hire you. Get a job (or at least a paper route).;\\n, Example: Instead of going on a date to dinner and a movie, go for a stroll through the park and have a picnic. (much more romantic anyway)\\n\\n, Then you won't be pressured to go to the mall or the movies and spend money with them.\\n\\n, Tell them that you would be much more encouraged to study harder and put more effort into your work if there was a cash reward. Tell them that it is your future, but you are just a kid. Kids need to work hard at school and have fun. If you had a cash reward for good grades, then you could both be happy.\\n\\n, Seriously. But write down where you hid it. Or tell someone. Then only allow yourself a certain amount of money a month.\\n\\n, Give yourself more time to save the money.\\n\\n, Whatever you are good at you can get paid for. You can tutor kids in a subject area you're especially good at: mow lawns, babysit, clean houses, run errands, anything.\\n\\n, Compare your electric bill to the same month as last year (try to get them to subtract inflation) and see if they'll pay you the balance. Also do dishes, sweep. Keep your room clean.\\n\\n, Have a friend burn a CD for you or go without. Don't buy extra junk food when you aren't really hungry; wait until you get home to eat.\\n\\n, For example, if you need a pen, don't buy one that is going to wear out the next day. By the same token, don't buy the most expensive pen out there.\\n\\n, You may find money still in old wallets or under the bed, or between sofa cushions.\\n\\n, Also, keep in mind that places such as TJ Max take clothes from name-brand stores and sell them for drastically cheaper than the original price. Thrift stores are also good for hidden treasures.\\n\\n, If you have some gift cards that you won't use, but know your parents can use them to purchase household cleaning items, discount clothing, etc.,then ask them if they will pay you in cash for whatever is left on the card. This can add up if you have lots of gift cards! The second use of gift cards is to use them. Go through all of your old wallets and take out all of the gift cards you find. Put them on a surface and separate into two piles:wanted and unwanted gift cards. Use the ones you wanted to keep.This will help you save up much extra money.\\n\\n,, Think a penny doesn't count? Think again. Keep all of your spare change in a piggy bank of some form, and when the pig is full take it to your local bank. You'll be surprised at how quickly those loose coins add up.\\n\\n, The Coin Master takes 8-10 cents per dollar which will really add up! If you originally had $100 worth of coins, then you took it to a coin star machine, it would take ten dollars or more out of your money. To get your change converted to dollar bills, go to a nearby bank and ask for some paper coin rolls. It is actually kind of fun to count all the change by hand. You never know how much it really is, and end up surprising yourself! Be sure to wash your hands when you are done.\\n\\n,,, Put all extra money you earn in a piggy bank. You will be surprised at how much it mounts up!\\n\\n,\""

       "\" If you are as young as 14, some companies will not hire you. Get a job (or at least a paper route).;\\n, Example: Instead of going on a date to dinner and a movie, go for a stroll through the park and have a picnic. (much more romantic anyway)\\n\\n, Then you won't be pressured to go to the mall or the movies and spend money with them.\\n\\n, Tell them that you would be much more encouraged to study harder and put more effort into your work if there was a cash reward. Tell them that it is your future, but you are just a kid. Kids need to work hard at school and have fun. If you had a cash reward for good grades, then you could both be happy.\\n\\n, Seriously. But write down where you hid it. Or tell someone. Then only allow yourself a certain amount of money a month.\\n\\n, Give yourself more time to save the money.\\n\\n, Whatever you are good at you can get paid for. You can tutor kids in a subject area you're especially good at: mow lawns, babysit, clean houses, run errands, anything.\\n\\n, Compare your electric bill to the same month as last year (try to get them to subtract inflation) and see if they'll pay you the balance. Also do dishes, sweep. Keep your room clean.\\n\\n, Have a friend burn a CD for you or go without. Don't buy extra junk food when you aren't really hungry; wait until you get home to eat.\\n\\n, For example, if you need a pen, don't buy one that is going to wear out the next day. By the same token, don't buy the most expensive pen out there.\\n\\n, You may find money still in old wallets or under the bed, or between sofa cushions.\\n\\n, Also, keep in mind that places such as TJ Max take clothes from name-brand stores and sell them for drastically cheaper than the original price. Thrift stores are also good for hidden treasures.\\n\\n, If you have some gift cards that you won't use, but know your parents can use them to purchase household cleaning items, discount clothing, etc.,then ask them if they will pay you in cash for whatever is left on the card. This can add up if you have lots of gift cards! The second use of gift cards is to use them. Go through all of your old wallets and take out all of the gift cards you find. Put them on a surface and separate into two piles:wanted and unwanted gift cards. Use the ones you wanted to keep.This will help you save up much extra money.\\n\\n,, Think a penny doesn't count? Think again. Keep all of your spare change in a piggy bank of some form, and when the pig is full take it to your local bank. You'll be surprised at how quickly those loose coins add up.\\n\\n, The Coin Master takes 8-10 cents per dollar which will really add up! If you originally had $100 worth of coins, then you took it to a coin star machine, it would take ten dollars or more out of your money. To get your change converted to dollar bills, go to a nearby bank and ask for some paper coin rolls. It is actually kind of fun to count all the change by hand. You never know how much it really is, and end up surprising yourself! Be sure to wash your hands when you are done.\\n\\n,,, Put all extra money you earn in a piggy bank. You will be surprised at how much it mounts up!\\n\\n,\""

Another way to look at age if you think of world gdp over the last ten thousand years i've actually taken the trouble is it passes for you in a graph it looks like this it take for normal condition i7 2600. In this century scientist mahila and awaken the power of artificial intelligence in ice cream i can see and enhance its position when they think about what is smart and what is term i sent have in mind a picture but the like this that one and we have listed yet. What we need to do is to issue more abstract not in terms of the word hollywood soon as we need to think of intelligence as an optimisation process at process that there's the future in a particular set of configuration in talend. Call to make semen smile when it will take control of the world and electrons in the facial muscles of humans. What we just shut it off a chimpanzees and resolve. That we have this on the contrary customer care wbtc by sitting in a box what is pictures of environment but for gravity simulation from which it cannot escape with it could be that the i can't find a bird but given that really shiva. A compound definition the values that your has its not just in the contacts. Solution to the control problem in advance so that i have it available by the time it is needed it might be that we cannot sold in fire control problem because maybe some elements can only be put in place once you know the details of the architecture work will be implemented within more of the control problem. Decide that one thing that will matter was to get this thing right.\""
