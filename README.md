The use of notes/textual descriptions in an educational video facilitates comprehension of the video's context and saves the viewer time and effort. As the quantity of lectures available online grows every day, traditional methods of extracting information such as viewing are becoming increasingly challenging. Because skipping all of the video source's content is not an option, it's critical that the viewer understands the video's context. We can save viewers a lot of effort and cut down the time they spend looking through videos, resulting in increased efficiency. These summaries may aid viewers in navigating massive video collections such as lectures, news, conference videos, podcasts, and other types of content.
